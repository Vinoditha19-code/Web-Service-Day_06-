Practical 01:
 In this Practical async and await are used to read two files at the same time. The Promise.allSettled method helps to read both files without stopping the program even if one file has an error. The result shows the status of each file read (success or fail).

Practical 02: 
This program reads a file using a callback function. It shows the file content if there is no error. The message "File reading is done....." will print first because reading the file takes some time (asynchronous). 

Practical 03:
This program uses Promise to read a file. If the file is read successfully, it shows the content. If there is an error, it shows the error message. Promise helps to handle success and error clearly in the code.

We created 2 files (data.txt and file.txtx) which contains some texts.
